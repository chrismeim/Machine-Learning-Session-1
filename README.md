# Machine-Learning-Session-1
Excercise on Imbalanced datasets on a credit fraud case

### Summary
In this session I am trying to explore various ways to handle imbalanced datasets, specific in the credit card fraud detection space

### In Detail
We'll use a credit card fraud detection dataset characterized by:

Transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.
Highly imbalanced class distribution.
The dataset is composed of 10000 rows.
Each row contains 30 features which are the result of a transformation.
Each feature vector is associated with a binary target: The target takes value 1 in case of a fraud and 0 otherwise.
The dataset is highly imbalanced since only 400 samples are associated with a target 1 (fraud).

### Objectives
Understand and Prepare the Data: Initial data exploration and preprocessing.
Develop a Baseline Model: To benchmark our improvements.
Implement Imbalance Handling Techniques: Including resampling and algorithm adjustments.
Evaluate Model Performance: Using metrics suited for imbalanced data.
